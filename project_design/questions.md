To determine if someone is eligible for grants in the Crofting Agricultural Grant Scheme, you can ask them the following questions:

1. Are you a tenant, owner-occupier, sub-tenant, or short-lease holder of a registered croft approved by the Crofting Commission? Only individuals in these categories are eligible for assistance under the scheme.

2. Is the work you are undertaking on the croft one that is assisted under the scheme? The work must align with the objectives set out in the scheme guidelines.

3. If you are a sub-tenant, have you obtained the principal tenant's permission for any improvement works you intend to carry out? It is important to have the necessary permissions and agreements in place.

4. Do you live within 20 miles (32 kilometers) of your croft? Assistance is not available if you live beyond this distance.

To qualify for the young farmer grant rates, you 	must meet certain conditions such as being under 41 	years of age, having set up as head of the business, 	and having adequate occupational skills and 	competence. Charities and trusts cannot benefit from 	the enhanced grant rate for young farmers.

There is a maximum limit on expenditure eligible for
grant, and investments that are simply to replace an
existing asset will not be eligible. The investment
must meet one or more of the objectives set out in
the guidelines.

You can appoint an agent to act on your behalf, but
you will still be responsible for meeting the
eligible costs and scheme rules, as well as any
penalties for rule breaches.

Once your application for prior approval has been
received, it will be assessed based on a scoring
system that considers the merits of each proposal
against various criteria. If your application is
successful, you will receive an offer of contract
letter stating the maximum grant you could receive
and any special conditions attached to it.

There are penalties for over-claiming, and any
claims that do not conform to the grant offer or the
work completed may be subject to penalties. It is
important to avoid claiming more than the eligible
costs set out in the offer of contract or the value
of the work actually completed.

There are statutory responsibilities that must be
complied with before grant is claimed, including
obtaining planning permission, complying with
building regulations, and meeting various other
regulations and requirements.

Eligibility for grant is restricted to tenants,
owner-occupiers, sub-tenants, or short-lease holders
of registered crofts approved by the Crofting
Commission. A business is defined as any one
agricultural business being undertaken by a tenant
or owner-occupier crofter, either individually or in
association or partnership with other crofters.

Examples of eligible work include the erection or
improvement of agricultural buildings, investment in
land management, field drainage, provision of
facilities for feeding livestock, improvement of
equipment for livestock handling, planting of shelter
belts, provision of amenities like water supplies and
electricity connections, and improvement of access
tracks and roads.

It's important to note that the work must not be solely
intended to replace existing improvements that serve
the same purpose as the original. However, support may
be available for first-time improvements, integral
elements of larger projects, or substantive upgrades.
